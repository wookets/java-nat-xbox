## APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

The Nerdery needs an application to track the interest in new games for our Xbox 360. This application will display the games 
we currently own, the games we would like to buy, and the number of votes for each game. Each employee at The Nerdery 
should be able to vote for their favorite game or add a new game to this list once per day. At the end of the week, if we reach our 
productivity goals the game with the most votes will be purchased and marked as a game we currently own. 
A database will be created to store the game and vote information. A user interface will be developed to display the games we 
own, display games we are voting on, and allow users to submit new titles for voting, and designate a game as owned.


## END USER DESCRIPTION

The end users of this application will be the programming staff at The Nerdery. The majority of these users prefer Google 
Chrome release channel for a web browser and are running Windows 8 Professional for an Operating System. It can be assumed 
that the programmers will only vote for their favorite game from their workstation on the LAN at The Nerdery headquarters, so 
setting a cookie to determine whether or not the user has voted is an acceptable low tech solution.


## WEB APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

The details for this web application are defined below. 


## DISPLAY GAMES

The user interface portion of the application will retrieve the games data via the database defined in the Database Specification 
section below. Games will be separated into those that we currently want, and those than we own. The games that we want will 
display the current vote count, and must be sorted by this vote count in descending order. The games that we own must be sorted 
alphabetically, and will not display the vote count.


## VOTE FOR A GAME

The user interface will provide the user with an ability to vote for any Xbox game that The Nerdery does not currently own, based 
on the restrictions defined below in "Voting and Add New Title Restrictions".


## ADD NEW TITLE/GAME

If an Xbox game is not currently in the list of games we want or own the user will have the ability to add that game to the list by 
providing the gameâ€™s title. There will be no validation that the title is an actual Xbox game but to keep the list clean duplicate 
titles will not be allowed.

Adding a new game will also automatically add the first vote on behalf of the user.


## VOTING AND ADD NEW TITLE RESTRICTIONS

Users must only be allowed to submit one vote or add one new game title per day (midnight to midnight). Additionally, voting or 
adding a new game title must be prohibited on Saturday and Sunday.


## MARKING A GAME AS OWNED

A separate page will exist to allow a user to indicate a game that we want is now owned. There will be no restrictions as to how 
many games can be owned.


## CODE EXPECTATIONS

The developer is expected to adhere to the following guidelines: 


## WELL DOCUMENTED

The application code will be created with the assumption that other developers will work on it in the future, so it should be 
readable and commented enough to make it easy for others to understand and maintain.


## FRAMEWORK AND TOOLSET

Where possible, the application code should utilize APIs built-in to the Java platform, as well as your selected web framework to 
perform tasks. The application code may pull in any third party libraries or tools, open or closed source, as needed, as long as they 
do not require a paid license.


## CODING STYLE

Code style should be consistent throughout the application and conform to industry accepted style conventions for the given 
language. The application code should be developed using the latest version of the language and should adhere to modern 
programming practices and style conventions.


## OBJECT ORIENTED

The code produced is expected to follow industry accepted object oriented principles and patterns. 


## ERROR HANDLING

All application errors must be handled gracefully and display user-friendly error messages if necessary. Submission should avoid 
common web security vulnerabilities and exploits.


## HTML CODING STYLE

The quality of the site design will not be judged, but the HTML must be semantic and valid.


## DATABASE SPECIFICATIONS

The application must use a relational database, such as MySQL, to store the games and votes. The following is the recommended 
minimum database pseudo-schema.


## GAMES TABLE
id - integer
title - text (Title of Game)
owned - boolean (default = false)
created - timestamp


## VOTES TABLE
gameId - integer
created - timestamp
